Dr. Matthew Ballard has been awarded a National Science Foundation grant.
The project titled "Collaborative Research: Derived Categories in Birational Geometry,
Enumerative Geometry, and Non-commutative Algebra" attempts to solve some of
the central and most recent questions about derived categories using techniques
developed by the principal investigators and many others over the last decade.
This award will also support undergraduate and graduate students.

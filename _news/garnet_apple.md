I've won the University of South Carolina's Garnet
Apple Award for Teaching Innovation.

The Garnet Apple Award for Teaching Innovation honors UofSC's exceptional
faculty who demonstrate an ongoing commitment to best teaching practices and an
ongoing record of developing innovative strategies to enhance student learning
in their courses. Five recipients received this yearâ€™s award and are to be
commended for their accomplishments.

Recognition was for chairing an ad hoc department committee whose
primary charge was to improve success rates of students in Math 141 and 142. I
took a leadership role in reforming  Calculus I (Math 141) and II (Math 142)
courses, facilitating a growth mindset in calculus classrooms by implementing a
system of Gateway Exams. The reforms yielded a striking decline in the failure
rate for Math 141 students. I also created accessible mathematical content
that benefits students who use screen readers and introduced the use of
interactive theorem provers to introductory proofs courses.

Dr. Keller VandeBogert, PhD 2021 and currently Kenna Visiting Assistant
Professor at the University of Notre Dame, was awarded a National Science
Foundation Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. The award
has a total amount of $150,000 for up to four years. 

The project, titled "Derived Categories and the Multigraded
Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand Correspondence‚Äù, seeks to use a generalization of the
classical BGG correspondence to reduce the computation of decompositions of
geometrically-defined derived categories to the computation of homological
invariants of certain classes of rings. The proposed work is to be done with
Dr. Claudiu Raicu at the University of Notre Dame, a well-known expert in the
use of representation-theoretic techniques for the purposes of homological
algebra and algebraic geometry.

The purpose of the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
(MSPRF) is to support future leaders in mathematics and statistics by
facilitating their participation in postdoctoral research environments that
will have maximal impact on their future scientific development. Only 35
MSPRF's are awarded annually.

Dr. VandeBogert is only the second awardee with a PhD earned in the State of
South Carolina. He was advised by Dr. Andy Kustin and Dr. Matthew Ballard.

Dr. Ballard in collaboration with Srikanth B. Iyengar, Pat Lank, Alapan Mukhopadhyay, Josh Pollitz
released a new article to the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18085).

Titled "High Frobenius pushforwards generate the bounded derived category", the
article concerns generators for the bounded derived category of coherent
sheaves over a noetherian scheme $X$ of prime characteristic. The main result is
that when the Frobenius map on $X$ is finite, for any compact generator $G$ of $D(X)$
the Frobenius pushforward $F^e_\ast G$ generates the bounded derived category whenever
pe is larger than the codepth of $X$, an invariant that is a measure of the
singularity of $X$. The conclusion holds for all positive integers $e$ when $X$ is
locally complete intersection. The question of when one can take  $G=\mathcal O_X$ is also
investigated. For smooth projective complete intersections it reduces to a
question of generation of the Kuznetsov component.

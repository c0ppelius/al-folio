Dr. Alicia Lamarche, PhD 2020 and currently NSF RTG Assistant Professor 
(Lecturer) at the University of Utah, was awarded a National Science
Foundation Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. The award
has a total amount of $150,000 for up to four years. 

The project, titled "Rationality and Derived Categories‚Äù, seeks to understand 
the relationship between rationality of varieties over general fields and 
the structure of their derived categories. Dr. Aaron Bertram at the 
University of Utah will serve as Dr. Lamarche's mentor for the work. 

The purpose of the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
(MSPRF) is to support future leaders in mathematics and statistics by
facilitating their participation in postdoctoral research environments that
will have maximal impact on their future scientific development. Only 35
MSPRF's are awarded annually.

Dr. Lamarche is first awardee who earned a PhD in the State of
South Carolina. She was advised by Dr. Matthew Ballard.

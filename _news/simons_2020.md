Dr. Matthew Ballard has been awarded a Simons Foundation Mathematics and Physical Sciences Collaboration Grant. 
The project tilted "Derived categories in algebraic and arithmetic geometry" seeks to 
understand the structure of derived categories for varieties over general fields. 

The goal of the Collaboration Grants program is to substantially increase collaborative contacts
between accomplished, active mathematicians in the United States.

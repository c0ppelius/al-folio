It is a deep honor to be named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

The AMS Fellows program recognizes members who have made outstanding
contributions to the creation, exposition, advancement, communication, and
utilization of mathematics.

It is a long journey from finishing second in a high school calculus contest.
Along the way I have benefited from my many mentors, colleagues,
and students. Immense gratitude goes to them and to my family for their
unwavering support.

I am grateful to the AMS for this recognition. I look forward to
contributing meaningfully to the mission of mathematics in the years to come.

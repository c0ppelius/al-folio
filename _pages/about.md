I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study and funding from UofSC and the Southeastern Conference. 

For more information about me, see my <a href="./Matthew_Ballard_CV.pdf">CV</a>. For a research summary and a list of my papers, take a look at my <a href="./research">research</a> page.
  
For a little of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the <a href="./teaching">teaching</a> page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the <a href="./mentoring">mentoring</a> page.

I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. For the full list of events, see the <a href="./organizing">organizing</a> page. If you are interested in participating, contact me.

I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising
from mirror symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and
their relation to more classical questions. I am also interested in formal
verification, particular of modern mathematics.

For more information about me, see my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/ballard_cv.pdf'
| prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">CV</a>. For a list of my
papers, please view the <a href="./publications/">publications</a> page.

For a little of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, see my <a
href="./teaching">teaching</a> page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride
in mentoring researchers at all stages and I regularly organize mathematical
events, even virtual ones. If you are interested in participating
in such an event, please contact me.

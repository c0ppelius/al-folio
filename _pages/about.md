I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from mirror symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. 

For more information about me, see my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/ballard_cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">CV</a>. For a list of my papers, please view the <a href="./publications/">publications</a> page.
  
For a little of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, see my <a href="./teaching">teaching</a> page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at all stages and I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. If you are interested in participating 
in such an event, please contact me.

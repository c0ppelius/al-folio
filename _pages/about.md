I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising
from mirror symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and
their relation to more classical questions. I am also interested in formal
verification, particularly of modern mathematics.

For more information about me, see my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/ballard_cv.pdf'
| prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">CV</a>. For a list of my
papers, please view the <a href="./publications/">publications</a> page.

I recently joined the maintainer group for [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.
github.io), the expansive library of mathematics formalized in the
[Lean](https://lean-lang.org) programming language. I always welcome a
chat about how formalization, particularly Lean, can make your life better
in the age of AI.

For a little of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, see my <a
href="./teaching">teaching</a> page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride
in mentoring researchers at all stages and I regularly organize mathematical
events, even virtual ones. If you are interested in participating
in such an event, please contact me.

### philosophy

A guiding principle for me, as an educator, is _Education is growth_. While
that may seem trite, it is essential to remember when teaching mathematics.

In our culture, mathematics suffers from a genius mentality. Either you are
good at mathematics or you are not. It is a self-reinforcing declaration. It
breeds depression from resignation. It favors those with many resources over
those with few. It binds itself to our existing prejudices and represents a
significant reason for the lack of diversity in math and beyond.

Those of us that fight each day for insight into mathematical problems find
this mentality absurd. While there are certainly Eureka moments, they are
always prefaced by long stretches of accretive growth in our understanding. We
grow in ways visible and invisible to create the capacity for each
breakthrough.

As the instructor, my priority in fostering a supportive and nurturing
classroom environment is to impart a growth mentality from the beginning.

Administratively, the structural changes I shepherd must provide resources and
motivation for personal growth.

Whether contributing to student's learning by standing with them in the
classroom or by shaping their experience from outside the classroom, I am never
shy about adopting emerging best practices and pedagogical technologies in
service of this goal.

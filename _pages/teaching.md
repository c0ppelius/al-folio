### Philosophy

A guiding principle for me, as an educator, is **Education is growth.**. While that may seem trite, 
it is essential to remember when teaching mathematics. 

In our culture, mathematics suffers from a genius mentality. Either you are good at mathematics or you are not. 
It is a self-reinforcing declaration. It breeds depression from resignation. It favors those with many resources over those with few. 
It binds itself to our existing prejudices and represents a significant reason for the lack of diversity in math and beyond.

Those of us that fight each day for insight into mathematical problems find this mentality absurd. While there are certainly Eureka 
moments, they are always prefaced by long stretches of accretive growth in our understanding. We grow in ways visible and 
invisible to create the capacity for each breakthrough. 

As the instructor, my priority in fostering a supportive and nurturing classroom environment is to impart a growth mentality from the beginning. 

Administratively, the structural changes I shepherd must provide resources and motivation for personal growth. 

Whether contributing to student's learning by standing with them in the classroom or by shaping their experience from outside 
the classroom, I am never shy about adopting emerging best practices and pedagogical technologies in service of this goal.
